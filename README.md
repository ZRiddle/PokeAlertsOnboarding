# Can you put bots in my area?

Yes! However, keep in mind our top priority is keeping stuff running.

## How can I help my area get bots?

Great question!

To request a zone, you can create a new issue [here](https://github.com/ZRiddle/PokeAlertsOnboarding/issues), please include these 2 things:

1. Channel name 
	- We're trying to use this naming convention \#[ut]-[city]-[area]
	- Look at the current examples above as a reference
2. Map boundaries
	- We need lat/long boundaries
	- Use the current [Millcreek Map](http://s2map.com/#order=latlng&mode=polygon&s2=false&points=40.718510,-111.902618%0A40.686496,-111.804322) as a reference
		- This tool isn't very user friendly but it draws a box given the top-right and bottom-left corners
		- If you find a better online tool for this, let us know!
	- Try to make your new zone roughly that size 
	- **Super Bonus Internet Points** if your new zone right next to a current one
		- Reference the [Channels section](#channels) above for nearby places to your zone
		- Put your lat/long boundaries on the boundaries of other current zone(s) 
		- Example: the upper bound of Millcreek is the lower bound for Sugarhouse
		- We will probably ignore zone requests that are overlapping current zone(s) (slight overlap on a border is acceptable)
		- We will likely prioritize new zone requests that nicely border existing zones


Continuing with the Millcreek as an example, you would deliver 2 things:

1. Channel name = \#ut-millcreek-west  
2. Map link = [This link](http://s2map.com/#order=latlng&mode=polygon&s2=false&points=40.718510,-111.902618%0A40.686496,-111.804322)

No promises that we can get your zone up, but doing this for us will make it **MUCH** more likely that we will

### Where do I request a new zone?

On the issues page [here](https://github.com/ZRiddle/PokeAlertsOnboarding/issues)
