# Helping Out

## Supporting the Community

So far the chat and comments have been positive and helpful.  Help us keep it that way!
If we don't have to babysit the chat then we get to spend time doing awesome things for this! 
Helping new users get started and answering questions also takes a lot off of our plate.

## Spreading the Good Word

We're excited to share this with more people.  If you know someone who will use this, invite them!
